# Visualize Boston Data

## About this Repository

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks where Data Visualization is carried out on datasets provided by [AnalyzeBoston](https://data.boston.gov/). It is more focussed on **Spatial Analysis** of data provided. Various python libraries are used such as folium, gmaps, pyplot, matplotlib, seaborn to carry out the data visualization process.

## Contents

- **Trees HeatMap** : - Based on the dataset provided by AnalyzeBoston which contained the latitude and longitude of more than 200k+ trees. Using the python gmaps library a heatmap of all the trees across Boston city were plotted over Google Maps using it's free developer API.

- **BostonCrimeData** : - Based on the dataset provided by AnalyzeBoston which contained the crime incidents reported in Boston from the 2015 to 2018. The data was analyzed after pre-processing it and some data visualizations were generated mostly focussed on the spatial part. All the major plots can be found [here](https://github.com/dwaipayan05/VisualizeBostonData/blob/main/BostonCrimeData/Results.md)

- **Boston AirBNB Spatial Plots** : - Based on the dataset from Kaggle which contained the housing details of AirBNBs around Boston. Spatial plots were made based on the average mean prices of AirBNBs and their location using geoplot & geopandas. All the major plots can be found [here](https://github.com/dwaipayan05/VisualizeBostonData/blob/main/BostonAirBnB/Results.md)
